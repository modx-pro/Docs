# About the project

## Introduction

This is documentation for [MODX Revolution](https://modx.com/) components, open to everyone.

It is a free Open Source project hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/modx-pro/Docs).
That allows anyone to contribute to the docs, fork the project, clone it, and change it to their liking.

## How it works

The docs are built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). Content is static text in simple markdown, with VitePress enhancements.
Compared to plain markdown, you get emoji, code highlighting and focus, colored warning blocks, and more.

The site is tied to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/modx-pro/Docs). Submit changes via Pull Request; once merged, they go live on the site.

## Authors and contributors

The Documentation project is maintained by the MODX community ([MODX RSC](https://github.com/modx-pro)) on a voluntary basis.
Every community member can contribute as an equal co-owner of the project.

## Financial support

This service is an Open-Source project; its maintenance and development depend on donations.
Donations help the team spend more time on the MODX community ecosystem.
