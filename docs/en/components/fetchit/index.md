# FetchIt

An lightweight Extra for processing forms using the Fetch API.

## Introduction

**CMS/CMF MODX Revolution** has [FormIt](https://github.com/Sterc/FormIt) component, which implements sending and processing forms, but it works by standard browser method, i.e. with page reloading. But the modern web is demanding and the progressive step is to process them «on the fly». **FetchIt**, which uses **FormIt**, is exactly for these tasks, but you can also use your own snippet.

## Features

For such purposes there is [AjaxForm](https://github.com/modx-pro/AjaxForm) component (although **FetchIt** is almost the same in its server part), but **FetchIt** has some advantages:

### Zero dependencies

**FetchIt** has no dependencies, while **AjaxForm** has three: Big [jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) library and its [jquery-form](https://github.com/jquery-form/form/) and [jGrowl](https://github.com/stanlemon/jGrowl) plugins.

While there's no problem with the latter (you can override methods to show notifications), the first two are tricky.

### Modern code

Minified script weighs 5 kilobytes and snippet registers it with attribute `defer`, thereby not preventing the page load.

### Comfort

Incorporating your wraparound, adding popup messages and modal windows, these are tasks that you can solve very easily.

## Installation

The extra is available for installation via Package Manager from:

- [modstore.pro](https://en.modstore.pro/packages/utilities/fetchit)
  - [How to connect to the repository](https://en.modstore.pro/faq)
- Official repository [modx.com](https://modx.com/extras/package/fetchit)

Or you can build a package from the component repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/GulomovCreative/FetchIt)
