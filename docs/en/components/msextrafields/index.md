# msExtraFields

The component is a miniShop2 plugin that lets you manage product attributes (regardless of custom handler classes in miniShop2), prices, product- and option-level discounts, group attributes, bind them to contexts (so you can run several stores from one manager), inherit from categories, notify customers about price changes, and work with mSearch2 out of the box. The main goal is to minimize duplicate products that differ only slightly.
