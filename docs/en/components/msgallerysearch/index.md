# msGallerySearch

The component adds buttons next to **Upload/Select file** for **minishop2** and **ms2Gallery** galleries.
It helps search for images and download them directly into the gallery without downloading to your computer.

It can also search and exchange images between **minishop2** and **ms2Gallery** galleries, transferring metadata.

## Buttons

- **Load from link** — download an image by pasting a URL
- **Find in Google** — search images via Custom Search JSON API
- **Find image** — search among images already added to the site
