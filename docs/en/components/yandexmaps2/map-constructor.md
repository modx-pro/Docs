# Map constructor

All main component work is in the map constructor. Any map starts here.
Constructor supports 4 object types:

1. Points, markers
2. Polylines
3. Polygons
4. Circles

**Important:** when using the map constructor in the backend when editing resources/users, you must save the resource/user object after changes. Otherwise map changes will **not** be applied!

_P.S. The constructor library for Yandex Maps was written from scratch and there are plans to release it for public use by developers._
