# Search

Manager page for testing search on the site.

Search here uses the same logic as the [mSearch2][1] and [mFilter2][2] snippets, but you can show all resources, including deleted and unpublished. Resources without "Participates in search" checked are not included.

You can open a found resource in the manager from the results.

So **mSearch2 adds full morphological search to MODX**.
