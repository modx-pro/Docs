# Synonyms

Here you define synonyms for user search queries.

If a query contains a word listed here, the synonym is added (or can replace the original). You can have many synonyms; they can add to or replace the original word.

So you can fix common typos in product names or elsewhere.

For example, for a product "whiskas" you can add:

- wiskas
- whiskas (alternate spelling)
- etc. — check your [queries][1]
