# System requirements and dependencies

## Minimum requirements

- miniShop2 works with MODX 2 only.
- PHP 7.0 minimum
- Recommended: PHP 7.4
- PHP ^8.0: stability not guaranteed

## Dependencies

miniShop2 uses pdoTools version ^2.

## Fenom template engine

**Optional**. We recommend using the [Fenom template engine](/en/components/pdotools/parser#shablonizator-fenom) from pdoTools for your templates and chunks.

It is easier to use and has more built-in features.
