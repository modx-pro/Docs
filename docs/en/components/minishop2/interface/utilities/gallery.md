# Gallery

**Available since version 4.2.2.**

Regenerate all product images according to media source settings.

Settings are in the media source. The interface has a quick link to the source for editing.

## Step-by-step

1. Check image resize parameters in the media source
2. Set how many products to process per run
3. Start processing by clicking **Update**

::: warning
Set the number of products based on your server. The more images per product, the lower this number should be. Too high a value can cause the gallery update to time out.
