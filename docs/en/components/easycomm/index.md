# easyComm

The easyComm component is for creating site sections and blocks such as:

- reviews;
- comments;
- user questions.

It also includes user ratings so reviews can rate items and display a rating.

The component works on MODX Revolution > 2.6 and MODX 3. Two installer packages are available in the extras store; the correct one is downloaded automatically based on your MODX version.
