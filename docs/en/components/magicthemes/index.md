# MagicThemes

Documentation is being prepared. What we know so far:

MagicThemes is a package for managing and creating themes on MODX Revolution.
Developed by Alexey Smirnov, inspired by CMS that ship themes out of the box.
In short, "themes for MODX" are ready-made designs you can use to build a full site in hours or days.
They are meant for quickly getting a working site live — for business, blog, shop, etc.

Why MagicThemes? The idea that MODX has no real concept of themes was widespread; themes were not really discussed. There are builds and add-ons that partly address this, but not fully. While designing the logic, it felt like "themes for MODX" had to be a bit of magic. Hence the name.
