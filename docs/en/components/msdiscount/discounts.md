# Discounts

Besides the promotion system you can set up separate discounts for user or product groups. Two tabs are available in the manager.

The component uses MODX resource and user groups; add members in the standard manager. You can open the groups page from the component.

Resource groups can include products and **their categories**.

For a user group you can set a purchase total; when reached, the user is added to the group. This enables cumulative discounts.

**Each group can have its own discount.**
