# Formalicious

Formalicious is a powerful add-on for building multi-step forms. It supports 8 field types, built-in validation, and FormIt hooks and advanced features.
It speeds up form creation for both admins and site visitors, with form management in a few clicks.

## 8 field types

With the right field types you can build forms for anything: contact forms, event registration, and more. Options include: text, textarea, email, number, checkboxes, radio buttons, select, and file upload.

## Multi-step forms

Build forms that span multiple pages without configuring temporary storage, per-step resources, or other tedious setup. Click "Create new step", add fields, and Formalicious handles the rest.

## Automatic validation

Mark a field as required in its settings and Formalicious validates it for you. Submitted values are also validated to protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Full FormIt support

For advanced FormIt features (pre- and post-hooks) or extra properties, Formalicious can add them to your forms.

## HTML emails and auto-replies

Each form can send to a specified email address, and the user can receive an automatic confirmation. All emails can be styled to match your brand.

## Saved data with 256-bit encryption

Saving form submissions is useful for backup but carries data-leak risk. FormIt uses 256-bit Rijndael encryption for stored data (requires mcrypt).

## Advanced settings

Formalicious has many options out of the box; you can add custom validators, field types, and email templates.
