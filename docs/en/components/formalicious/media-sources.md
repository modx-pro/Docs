# Media sources

Formalicious sets one system setting, `formalicious.source`, default value `1` (default files source).

To choose attachments for auto-replies from another source, change this setting.

You can see all media sources under **Media** > **File sources** in the main menu. The first column shows the source ID to use in `formalicious.source`.
