# Field Types

A form consists of fields. These fields can be categorized by type. Formalicious is shipped with the most common field-types by default:

- Checkboxes
- Email
- File
- Number
- Radiobuttons
- Select
- Text
- Textarea

All these types have a **Chunk** associated with them. These can be found in the Elements-tree, below the Formalicious-category.
These chunks are optimized for [Bootstrap][1]

All the required fields are implemented in Formalicious, but you can change these chunks to match your needs.
**It is recommended to duplicate and rename a field before changing it**, because an update of Formalicious will override the original chunks.

## Creating your own field type

All the fields necessary area available by default, but we offer creative freedom here. You can create your own types with your own chunks.

### Step 1: Create the type

Create your type and enter a **Name** and **Tpl**. The **Value Tpl** field is only to determine your options for checkbox and radiobutton fields.

The **Validation** field can be used to use [FormIt validators][2].

In the example below we create a field called "Special email", with the template "specialEmailTpl":

### Step 2: Create the associated chunk

We specified the chunk called "specialEmailTpl". This chunk is a regular FormIt-chunk.
Please check the [FormIt tutorials][3] for all your options.

Below is an example of our "Special email Tpl" (copy of emailTpl):

**And that's it, you're all set!**
