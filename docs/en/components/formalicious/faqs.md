# FAQs

We're collecting the questions we get most often into a list of FAQs.

## How do I show my created form?

Make sure that you marked your form as Published, and then add the following snippet call where you want the form to appear (without the spaces):

```modx
[[!renderForm? &form=`FORM ID HERE`]]
```

You can also use a template variable to select the form, and to place the template variable value in the form property.

## I want to setup custom validation per field

This can be accomplished by going to the creating (or editing) a field-type in the admin-panel.
You can mention a comma-separated list of FormIt-validators in the **Validation** field in the dialog-window.

## I don't like the emails sent by Formalicious

Everything is customizable by using chunks or FormIt parameters.
First, create a duplicate of the email-chunk (`emailFormTpl` or `fiarTpl`) you wish to change and rename it.
Then go to the form which should use this new chunk.

Go to the **Advanced** section and click **Add parameter**.
Set the parameter-key to **emailTpl** or **fiarTpl** and set the value to the chunk you just made.
