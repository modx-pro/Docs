# Plugin events

These plugin events allow you to:

- Increase/apply product discount based on item quantity in cart,
- Give discount only on a specific product option, e.g. XXL size shirt,
- Get final product cost minus discount (equal to discount per unit) regardless of that item's quantity in cart,
- And **much more**, limited only by your imagination!

_Event list is in execution order._
