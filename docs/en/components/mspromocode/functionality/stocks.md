# Promotions

For each promotion you can generate a batch of coupons by a specified mask.

You can set the discount for all coupons, promotion start and end dates, products and categories the promotion applies to. In any generated coupon you can override these settings by checking the `Freeze` checkbox (this keeps the coupon unchanged when the promotion is saved).

You can download the coupon list in CSV format for a promotion.
