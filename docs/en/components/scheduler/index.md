# Scheduler

Scheduler by MODX creator Mark Hamstra is a deferred task manager.
It is used to run tasks on a schedule in the background: import/export, sending emails, notifications, and any work that does not need to run immediately.

It lets you run any snippet, processor or PHP file at a time you specify.
