# cityFields

The component lets you split the site by city without creating contexts. Each city can have its own domain, subdomain or subdirectory.

The component provides:

* Adding cities to the list.
* Binding domain, subdomain or subdirectory to a city.
* City detection by IP.
* Unique content per city.
* miniShop2 product price management per city.

Cities are added manually. City detection by IP uses the SypexGeo database.

Two component versions are supported:

1. Version 1.x.x-pl for MODX 2.
2. Version 2.x.x-pl for MODX 3.

On modstore.pro you purchase the component and the correct version is installed based on your MODX version. You do not need to buy a specific version separately.
