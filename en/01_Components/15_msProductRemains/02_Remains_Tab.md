After the extra is enabled, a new “Remains” tab will appear in the miniShop2 product resource. It will contain a table for remains editing.

To get a complete remains table, it is necessary to fill in products properties in advance (color and size by default) and save and update the remains table (or reload the page).

To edit remains, double-click the left mouse button on the number you want to change. Then a field for entering remains amounts will appear. Input a new remains amount, press Enter, and the new amount of remains will be saved in the database.
