- **order** - order data array from `msOrder`object
- **products** - ordered goods array with all their properties
- **user** - data array of `modUser` and `modUserProfile`objects with all customer's characteristics
- **address** - data array of `msAddress` object with delivery data
- **delivery** - array of selected delivery characteristics of`msDelivery` object
- **payment** - array of selected payment characteristics of`msPayment`object
- **total** - totals order array:
    - **cost** - total order cost
    - **weight** - total order weight
    - **delivery_cost** - separate delivery cost
    - **cart_cost** - separate ordered goods cost
    - **cart_weight** - total weight of the ordered goods
    - **cart_count** - ordered goods number

## Order creation
It is recommended to call this snippet in junction with the others on ordering page:
```
[[!msCart]] <!-- Cart view and change, hidden after order creation -->

[[!msOrder]] <!-- Ordering form, hidden after order creation -->

[[!msGetOrder]] <!-- Order information display, showed after its creation -->
```

## Writing letters
This snippet  is used by miniShop2 class for writing mail notification to customers, if you switch on such sending in [status settings][3].

All the letters expand single basic mail template **tpl.msEmail** and change its blocks by default:
- **logo** - logo of the shop with home page reference
- **title** - letter title
- **products** - ordered goods table
- **footer** - site reference in letter footage

For example, the letter with new customer's order, is:
```
{extends 'tpl.msEmail'}

{block 'title'}
    {'ms2_email_subject_new_user' | lexicon : $order}
{/block}

{block 'products'}
    {parent}
    {if $payment_link?}
        <p style="margin-left:20px;{$style.p}">
            {'ms2_payment_link' | lexicon : ['link' => $payment_link]}
        </p>
    {/if}
{/block}
```
As you can see, the main template is inherited, the title is changed, and payment reference is added to the table of goods (if any).
