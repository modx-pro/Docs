Here you search by that same algorithm that is used by snippets [mSearch2][1] \\ [mFilter2][2], but you can also show all resources, including remote and unpublished ones.
Resources that don’t have the corresponding parameter ‘searchable’ matched don’t participate in search.

This page has an interesting feature: it gives you an opportunity to go to the page of a result found in admin area.
That is, **mSearch2 adds morphological search of full value to your control system MODX**.
